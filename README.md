Proton stopping power
The code in python consist of a simple routine to calculate the stopping power for protons in water. Then it loads the data 
from the data folder, plot them and fit the data to two models for the calculation of stopping powers, the Bethe-Bloch formula and
the Bragg-Kleeman rule.
